\b;From Mission Control
We were performing scan of this region in normal mode, not really reckoning to discover anything worth of attention amongst all these ruins. However, at some point we suddenly got response from an unknown source: as it turned out a \l;radar station\u object\radar; is still functioning in this place even to this time.

Destruction of this installation by aliens is only a matter of time - and we already spotted a population of \l;giant ants\u object\ant; that will soon migrate through this area from south-west to north-east; on their way they most certainly will be attracted to the \l;radar station\u object\radar; and obliterate it.

However, we also discovered few bots near \l;the station\u object\radar;, including \l;shooters\u object\botfr;. We give control over local infrastructure, or rather what remained of it, to you: we want you to utilize local resources in order to hold out incoming inroad. Later we will readjust this \l;radar station\u object\radar; as well as reinforce this whole object.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
