\b;From Mission Control
We are close to complete our project of \l;nuclear plant\u object\nuclear; that you will actually be able to build yourself, therefore you should extract 10 pieces of \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore; from subsoil for your needs.

Deposit of \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore; is located on the hill southward from your \l;space ship\u object\base;. You do not need to go all the way to the top of it though as you will most certainly find a place for a \l;derrick\u object\derrick; on the foot of the hill which your \l;wheeled grabbers\u object\botgr; should reach easily.

As far as we know the hill is occupied by aliens. We provide you with a new way to deal with them: a bot we call "\l;thumper\u object\bottump;", schemes of which you will see in a \l;research center\u object\research;. This weapon will not kill these aliens, but it will neutralize them for a limited amount of time. We suggest you to take this time to install a \l;defense tower\u object\tower; right in the place, which will eliminate dangerous insects nearby. After that you will be able to begin with regular procedure of finding and extraction relatively safely.

Before you take off take aboard a \l;grabber\u object\botgr; and a \l;thumper\u object\bottump;, we are certain that you will need the later in your following missions.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
