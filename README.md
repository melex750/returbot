Returbot is a usermod for Colobot Gold 0.1.11+ which aims to contain large variety of levels, just like original story mode. There is no astronaut and all the levels are intended to be passable for those who want to use only programming. Complexity of useful programming becomes wider with every chapter, although this is not a straight programming course but rather just a game with various challenges.

<h5>Status:</h5>

Creation of this mod is still near beginning as number of version hints, not even half of levels is done yet and no programs for bots were written at all. However, this mod already contains fully playable levels, even full chapters, which means that you may download and play it. Mind that sometimes this stuff might be updated very frequently and updates may include important changes.

<h5>Installation:</h5>

Simply put both /returbot/ and /returbot_music/ folders / archives either into "C:\Users\username\colobot\mods\" directory on Windows or into "/home/username/.local/share/colobot/mods/" directory on Linux.

<h5>Issues (PAY ATTENTION):</h5>

There are serious issues that you should know about. [Colobot](https://github.com/colobot/colobot) itself is still in the state of active development, but Returbot already heavily relies on features that are relatively new and have unfixed bugs. Overall, most of the time everything should be fine. Right until you make & load a savegame in certain level. Here are these levels in which related issues might occur, sorted by severity of troubleness:
<br>
* ~4-4 "Explosives". 100% guarantee that [the game will crash or level controller will stop functioning after loading a savegame made in this level](https://github.com/rbcat/returbot/issues/1). Do not use savegames in this level.~  [Fixed.](https://github.com/rbcat/returbot/pull/3) Now making savegames in this level most likely should be safe.
* 5-1 "Concussion". Should you load a savegame made in this level [this crap](https://github.com/rbcat/returbot/issues/2) will happen. Level controller also might stop functioning. Do not use savegames in this level.
* 6-1 "Beyond reach". Chances are low yet existent that level controller will go wild and then stop functioning. Should it happen - restart the Colobot. Then, most likely, you may load your savegame evenly.
* 5-4 "All round". This level uses level controller very heavily, thus something very well might go wrong. But as I've never tested savegames in this level, I can't say anything definitely. Use savegames there at your risk or better don't.
* 3-6 "Attraction". This level uses level controller at little extent, yet no problems with savegames occured so far. You can make & load savegames there safely.

<h5>Plot:</h5>

Several expeditions consisting entirely of bots were sent to find a planet that should soon become alternative to Earth. One of expeditions succeeded and sent a signal back to Earth using a communication estabilished on variety of transitional planets and maintained by automatic system. On the Earth there was a space ship capable to perform hyper jumps. Using it's unique ability it jumped from Earth to Terranova - the planet found by bots. After that, however, a problem occured - long connection between Earth and Terranova suddenly got lost. And now it is your mission to travel back from Terranova to Earth through each planet used for connection and, amongst performing other tasks, restore these communications. You will reside in a low orbital module without need to get outside and all the work will be done by bots under your control.
