\b;From Mission Control
Our current priority is to investigate conditions in which radar site installed on Centaury might have been disabled. We've already obtained a lot of unusual information while studying satellite observations and we have some serious materials corroborating one of our theories in this respect. For full certitude we only miss a little.

Your current mission is to inspect a site north-west from where your \l;space ship\u object\base; is landed in which a shipwreck had it's place. The best way to reach it is to move straight northward and then turn to the south-west. Destroyed \l;space ship\u object\base; belonged to a workgroup directly engaged in service of the radar site, and furthermore, recently we have detected suspicious activity there, therefore any data that you will get from there - be it data from a \l;black box\u object\bbox; that might have survived the accident, records made by you or intelligence of other kind - will tell us more about reasons behind loss of the radar site.
