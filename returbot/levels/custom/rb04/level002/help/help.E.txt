\b;From Mission Control
In the north-west from your location a radar site is functioning, however, quality of connection with it is unsatisfactory. As it turned out, reason behind this is various junk congested in the crater in which the site is located. Your task is to scavenge the crater - remove all the \l;wrecks\u object\wreck; and \l;any\u object\titanore; \l;other\u object\titan; \l;objects\u object\power cell; that you will discover within it's borders. For this you can use any means available to you, be they \l;grabbers\u object\botgr;, \l;recyclers\u object\botrecy; or \l;shooters\u object\botfr;. In the process be careful and don't wreck any of \l;radar stations\u object\radar;. We send you access codes for objects on Volcano - somewhere in this area you will find a functioning base with everything you will need.
