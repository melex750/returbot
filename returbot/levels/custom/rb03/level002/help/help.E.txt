\b;From Mission Control
What happened to your bot in it's form resembled a well organized ambush, as if those insects were expecting you to arrive. This incident left us with no more doubts: alien life forms inhabiting this planet are directly responsible for destruction of many installations on it. Previous expeditions often overlooked this factor whilst choosing locations for installation of objects and thus were attacked by hostile life forms. You most certainly will have to face them multiple times again. Later the previous expeditions have developed a large variety of tools for dealing with them and you will soon have to retrieve one of them in order to examine it's construction.

However, before that, you must retrieve a \l;black box\u object\bbox; which amongst other things contains access codes for controllable objects on Centaury. This \l;black box\u object\bbox; must be inside a vault located northward from your \l;space ship\u object\base;. To open the vault you should take \l;key A\u object\key; and put into vacant slot of the vault. You should be careful on the way because this camp is surrounded with \l;mines\u object\mine; which explode instantly whenever something gets into contact with them.

From now on we will keep track of activity of giant insects more precisely and try to learn their habits. We advise you not to forget to address to satellite report whenever you arrive to a place in order to get more information about their activity in current region.
