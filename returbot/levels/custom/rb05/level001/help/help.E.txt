\b;From Mission Control
We are close to complete our project of \l;nuclear plant\u object\nuclear; that you will actually be able to build yourself, therefore you should extract 8 pieces of \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore; from subsoil for your needs.

As we know there are aliens in the deposit of \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore;. Satellite failed to determine their specific affiliation, but we are absolutely certain that these are \l;worms\u object\worm;, especially because deposit of \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; is also there. We don't know what it could be concerned with, but it appears that \l;worms\u object\worm; on Saari are attracted to \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore;. Though, you don't have to worry too much, given that this threat is rather static.

You will not be able to start extraction while there are \l;worms\u object\worm; in the deposit, but you also will not be able to exterminate them while they reside underground. You will have to force them out of subsoil and a bot able to inflict powerful jolts to the ground which we call "\l;thumper\u object\bottump;" will help you in that case. If you will use it then these \l;worms\u object\worm; being sensitive to ground vibrations most certainly will leave subsoil and emerge on surface. After that you will be able to exterminate them with regular means.

Before you take off take aboard a \l;thumper\u object\bottump;, we are certain that you will need it in your following missions.

\b;The worms
You should be very cautious, because this kind spreads a dangerous virus in range up to 40 meters which also increases along with altitude relative to spreader. Though, should these insects be stunned by a \l;thumper\u object\bottump; they will leave subsoil and their abilities will become very confined. Besides, buildings and bots that are dead on power or aboard of a \l;space ship\u object\base; are relatively safe.

\b;The virus
This type tampers with critically important junction within power systems which turns any bot or building supplied with power disabled. If while you control a bot it becomes infected with it, you should stop it immediately, as soon as you get warning. The virus will be in power even after killing all the \l;worms\u object\worm; and the only way to "cure" the bot from it is to discharge it, i.e. take out it's \l;battery\u object\power; and wait a second. After that you could return the \l;battery\u object\power; to it's place and use the bot as usual. Of course, before doing that you should make sure that there are no \l;worms\u object\worm; left nearby.
