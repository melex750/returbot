\b;From Mission Control
Unfortunately, your \l;space ship\u object\base; suffered a shipwreck. This is rather bizarre and unique case, because as it appears one of bots from your expedition have survived it, even though usually no equipment such as robots survives such an incident.

You now need to reach a neighbour area, because according to our data somewhere there one of previous expeditions left a functioning \l;space ship\u object\base;. We managed to decode data on jet engines for bots retrieved by you, and now, to make winged bots reproducible, you will only need to launch a program in a \l;research center\u object\research;. As you will get a working \l;winged grabber\u object\botgj;, send it along the river receding to the north to move to the neightbour area.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
