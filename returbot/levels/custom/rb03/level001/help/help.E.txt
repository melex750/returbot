\b;From Mission Control
Your \l;space ship\u object\base; succesfully and uneventfully landed on Centaury and this fact by itself couldn't leave us in dejection.

Our current priority is to investigate conditions in which radar site installed on Centaury might have been disabled. We already obtained a lot of unusual information while studying satellite observations and we have some serious materials corroborating one of our theories in this respect. For full certitude we only miss a little. We want you to dispatch one of your bots for intelligence gathering. Both of your bots are supplied with cameras which as you read this message already cast translation in real time mode. This way, even if you will not be able to return your bot before it's power will exhaust, all the data gathered by it including records of it's onboard camera will be received by us in corpore.

Try to start from inspecting a site south-east from where your \l;space ship\u object\base; is landed in which a shipwreck had it's place. As far as we know ruined \l;space ship\u object\base; belonged to a workgroup directly engaged in service of the radar site, and thus any data that you will get from there - be it data from a \l;black box\u object\bbox; that might have survived the accident, records made by you or intelligence of other kind - will tell us more about reasons behind loss of this installation. As soon as you think that you've got enough of material for us you could take off.

Of course, before taking off you should return at least one of your \l;grabbers\u object\botgr; aboard of your \l;space ship\u object\base;.
